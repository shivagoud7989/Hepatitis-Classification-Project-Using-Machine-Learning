# Hepatitis-Classification-Project-Using-Machine-Learning
This is an internship project done by my group. In this project we have came across different types of diseases in hepatitis and we predicted that the patient will die or not.
classification data description

ABOUT THE DATA : The Hepatitis Variables dataset, contains both categorical and numerical variables, which facilitates the application of diverse machine learning algorithms to classify an individual's survival from hepatitis.

Variable Name Role Type Description Class Target Categorical Classifies Survival status of an Individual Age Feature Integer Gives the Age of the person in number Sex Feature Categorical Gender of the person Steroid Feature Categorical Use of Steroids as part of the treatment for hepatitis Liver Big Feature Categorical Gives the status of Size of the liver Liver Firm Feature Categorical Gives the status of Firmness of the liver
